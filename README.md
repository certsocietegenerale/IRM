IRM-2022 (Incident Response Methodologies 2022)
=====================================

CERT Societe Generale provides easy to use operational incident best practices. These cheat sheets are dedicated to incident handling and cover multiple fields in which a CERT team can be involved. One IRM exists for each security incident we're used to dealing with.

CERT Societe Generale would like to thank [SANS](https://www.sans.org/) and [Lenny Zeltser](https://zeltser.com/cheat-sheets/) who have been a major source of inspiration for some IRMs.

Feel free to contact us if you identify a bug or an error in these IRMs.
